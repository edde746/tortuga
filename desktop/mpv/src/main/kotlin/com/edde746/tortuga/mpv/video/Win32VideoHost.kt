/**
 * Windows: mpv (`vo=gpu-next`, d3d11) renders into a disabled child of the Skiko canvas HWND, and Compose draws
 * above it through Skiko's DirectComposition swapchain (`compose.interop.blending=true`, set by the app before Compose
 * starts), so transparent Compose pixels show the video. The child's own window class paints it black until mpv's first
 * frame (a system control such as `STATIC` paints the system's light grey). `WS_DISABLED` sends all mouse input over the
 * video to the canvas (Compose); mpv never sees input.
 *
 * The child lives on its own thread with its own message pump: AWT never pumps windows it did not create, and
 * DestroyWindow must run on the creating thread. It is sized from the canvas client rect rather than Compose bounds,
 * which come out 1 px short at 150 % scaling.
 *
 * While a host's child window exists the process is exempt from Windows power throttling (EcoQoS and ignored timer
 * resolution). Without that, a window behind others with nothing audible (muted, or no audio device) played 4K60 HDR10
 * at 0.2× real time with ~4 dropped frames/s on a Ryzen 5 7600X with an RTX 4090; exempt, it plays at 1.0× with no
 * drops after the start.
 * The exemption is one switch for the whole process, so the hosts count themselves: the last one gone hands it back,
 * and a previous playback's slow teardown can't clear it under the next one.
