"""Check the installed Tortuga Flatpak against its runtime, not the build SDK, and its sandbox's permissions.

Run after `flatpak install --user tortuga-linux-<arch>.flatpak`, under a session bus (`dbus-run-session -- ...`).
Inside the sandbox, with nothing on LD_LIBRARY_PATH: every ELF object of the app image and /app/lib resolves all its
dependencies, the bundled runtime is JetBrains Runtime, libmpv is in the app's resources and every licence text the
Linux app ships is in the app image's resources, where About reads it, and in /app/share/licenses/com.edde746.tortuga:
licenses/apps.json's linux groups of the repository's licenses/ in the resources' licenses/ and at that folder's top,
and the licenses/ folder of the libmpv artifact the app image was built with (desktop/mpv/build/mpv/<arch>/licenses)
in the resources' mpv/licenses/ and that folder's mpv-build/. Then what the
app relies on in the sandbox, whose home folder is in memory: with a Videos folder on the host (a temporary one, named
in a user-dirs.dirs of its own), the sandbox's Videos folder is the host's and a file written in its Tortuga folder
(the default downloads folder, DesktopDownloads.linuxFolder) is on the host; and the session bus lets the app own its
MPRIS name (LinuxMediaControls.BUS_NAME) while it refuses one outside the app id's. This does not replace running the
app in a Wayland session.
