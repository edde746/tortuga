/**
 * The test report's journal ([TestReport], `report.jsonl`): one JSON record per line, in the order they were appended,
 * each handed to the OS as it is appended, so every record written is there however the process ends. A record is
 * compact JSON, which escapes the line breaks inside its strings, so a line is one whole record, and a last line
 * without its line break is one the process was cut off writing: the desktop test harness's readers ignore it.
 * Opening it replaces the file at [path].
