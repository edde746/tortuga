/**
 * Whether the computer is online, for [com.edde746.tortuga.app.AppBootstrap.onNetworkChanged]: checked every few
 * seconds on a daemon thread, online while the system has a route out to the internet, for IPv4 or IPv6. Each check
 * connects a UDP socket to a documentation address (192.0.2.1, 2001:db8::1), which sends nothing: the OS only picks
 * the route, and refuses when there is none (a default route is the usual one). So an adapter that is up with an
 * address but no way out, as Hyper-V's and WSL's vEthernet, Docker's and VMware's are, doesn't keep the app online with
 * the network gone. [report] hears the first answer and each change, on that thread. The desktop can't tell a metered
 * network, so it reports none.
