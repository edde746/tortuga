/**
 * One app per data directory. The first start on a directory locks `instance.lock` there and listens on a loopback
 * port it writes to `instance.port`, with a random token and its process id (a file only its user can read). A later
 * start, such as the one the OS makes for a `stremio:` link while Tortuga runs, sends that app the token and its link
 * (the token alone for a plain start, which brings the window forward) and exits once the app answers `ok`; on Windows
 * it first lets the app's process take the foreground, which Windows otherwise keeps from a process the user didn't
 * just start. It waits for that answer as long as its patience lasts and sends its link again only when the app hung up
 * without taking it, so the app takes each start's link once, however late it answers. The app takes nothing else: a
 * line without the token, longer than [MAX_LINE_BYTES] or unfinished after [READ_TIMEOUT_MILLIS], or whose link isn't a
 * `stremio:` link (the one scheme the desktop registers and the one a user can pass on the command line; a
 * `tortuga://watch` invite is pasted into the app) is refused unanswered. While the app shuts down, a start waits for
 * it to end and is the next app. The OS releases the lock when the process ends, however it ends, so a crashed app
 * holds nothing and the next start writes a new port file over the old one.
