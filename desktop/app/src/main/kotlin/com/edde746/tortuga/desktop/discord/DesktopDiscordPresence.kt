/**
 * Discord's Rich Presence on Windows and Linux ([DiscordPresenceHost]): the connection to the Discord app runs on a
 * thread of its own, started at the first activity, so nothing the app's main thread or the player does waits for
 * Discord. Only the newest activity counts: while one is being sent, later ones replace each other.
 *
 * While there is an activity to show, the thread stays connected: when Discord isn't running (or [open] finds no
 * endpoint it answers on) it tries again every [retry], and when Discord quits it notices within [poll] and connects
 * again, sending the activity anew. Without one it takes the activity down and disconnects. Each kind of failure is
 * logged once until the next connection, so Discord missing for hours writes one line.
 *
 * @param applicationId the Discord application the activity shows as, which each handshake names.
 * @param open the first endpoint Discord answers on ([openDiscordPipe]), or null.
