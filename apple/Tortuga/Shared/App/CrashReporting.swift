/// Kotlin exceptions nothing caught reach the same crash handler: the shared hook (`UncaughtKotlinExceptions.record`)

/// sent at the next launch with the setting on, its Kotlin frames symbolicated from the app's dSYM (TortugaKit is
/// linked into the app's binary).
///
/// The Kotlin exceptions the app survived (`CrashReports.failures`: a coroutine of the product that threw, which the
/// shared failure boundary logged and the app ran on after) go out at once as error events, their stacks the Kotlin
/// throw site's, symbolicated as a crash's.
///
/// Every event is scrubbed before it leaves (`scrubbed`): no user, no device id, no request, and every free text and
/// path through the shared `CrashReports.scrub` (addon and stream URLs keep only their origin, keys and ids go, the home
