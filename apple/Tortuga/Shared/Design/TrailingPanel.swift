/// screen behind it. The panel is 740 pt wide inside the safe area (820 pt with the screen's trailing safe area, which

/// panel's surface (`isInSheet`: an account page draws no background of its own there). The screen under the cover
/// stays focusable, so the content moves focus in when it shows, and what it shows with nothing to focus (loading, a
/// check running) holds focus (`holdsBackFocus`: the panel is a pushed screen). `id` is its accessibility identifier.
