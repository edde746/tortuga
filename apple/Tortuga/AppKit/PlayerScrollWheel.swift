/// keymap turns into the volume (`InputEvent.Wheel`: 5 points a notch, up louder), as the Compose desktop player does on
/// Windows and Linux. A mouse wheel's click is one notch however fast it turned (macOS accelerates its delta); a
/// trackpad's or Magic Mouse's scroll is a notch per 100 points, as mpv's own Mac input counts it (`deltaY` × 0.1), its
/// momentum after the fingers lift left out. The direction is the device's, as a mouse wheel's on Windows and Linux:
/// the wheel turned away, or two fingers moved up, is louder, also where natural scrolling (the Mac's default) turns
/// the event's delta round. Over the controls the wheel does nothing.
///
/// SwiftUI has no scroll-wheel event, and an AppKit view that took the wheel would sit in the video's way for its
/// clicks and hovers. So this view takes no events: it watches the app's scroll events in its window while the pointer
/// is on the video (`onVideo`, the video's hover) and keeps those the store used.
