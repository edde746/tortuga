/// The window while the player is up (macOS), as QuickTime Player has it: no toolbar (whose back button and title
/// belong to the screen under the player), the video under the whole window, the title bar transparent and without
/// its title (the player draws the title beside the window's buttons), and those buttons coming and going with the
/// controls. Everything is handed back as it was when the player goes.
///
/// Full screen hides the title bar until the pointer reaches the top edge, where it comes down under the menu bar.
/// The player's title row keeps the window's buttons there all the same: copies of them
/// (`NSWindow.standardWindowButton(_:for:)`: they act on the window and grey out while it isn't key, as the title
/// bar's do) where the title bar has them in a window, which the title row hosts (`PlayerWindowButtons`), so they
/// fade with the controls. Minimize is greyed out, as in AppKit's full-screen title bar (a full-screen window can't be
/// minimized); zoom leaves full screen. AppKit draws the buttons' symbols on hover only in its own title bar, so the
/// copies show none. The title bar that comes down in full screen keeps its own buttons: it is opaque (the screens'
/// is see-through, `FullScreenTitleBar`) and covers the title row, copies and all, under the menu bar, so one set shows
/// either way (without them it would come down empty while the controls show). The copies come as the window starts
/// into full screen, under the title bar's own, so the buttons stay through AppKit's transition; they go once the
/// window is out, where the title bar's own sit in the same place: leaving shows no jump.
///
/// It also tells the player when the window enters or leaves full screen, whoever asked (the green button, the View
/// menu, the player's own button), so the store's keymap and full-screen button follow, and where the pointer goes
/// when it leaves the player's views for something that isn't them. Out of the window's frame, the pointer left the
/// player. Still over the window, it is under a window of its own: the app's (a button's tooltip, the zoom button's
/// menu) belong to the controls the pointer was on, so nothing changes; another app's (the menu bar that comes down in
/// full screen) are no part of the controls, which stay and hide on their timer as at rest. A menu AppKit tracks (the
/// controls' menus) is the exception: AppKit reports the pointer leaving the player's area for it only once it has
/// closed, the pointer still where the pick left it, out of the window's frame when the menu hung below the window.
/// The pointer hasn't left the player then, the menu took it there: it is off the controls, which stay up on their
/// timer, so a pick shows in them wherever the menu hung.
