/// Discord's Rich Presence on the Mac (`DiscordPresenceHost`), as the desktop app has it on Windows and Linux: the
/// connection to the Discord app runs on a thread of its own, started at the first activity, so nothing the main thread
/// or the player does waits for Discord. Only the newest activity counts: while one is being sent, later ones replace
/// each other.
///
/// While there is an activity to show, the thread stays connected: when Discord isn't running (no endpoint answers) it
/// tries again every `retry`, and when Discord quits it notices within `poll` and connects again, sending the activity
/// anew. Without one it takes the activity down and disconnects. Each kind of failure is logged once until the next
/// connection, so Discord missing for hours writes one line. When the app quits, the connection closes with the
/// process and Discord takes the activity down itself.
///
/// Discord listens on the Unix sockets `discord-ipc-0` to `-9` in the user's temporary folder, `TMPDIR`, which the app
/// shares with it, not being sandboxed; `DiscordRpc` has the frames' opcodes and JSON. Each handshake names the Discord
