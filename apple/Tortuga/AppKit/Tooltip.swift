/// menu in their custom styles (26 Oct); on Detail's plain glass buttons (29 Oct, macOS 27) none on Share when the
/// pointer came onto it after resting in the window's middle since the screen opened (5 of 6), none on Share when the
/// pointer came back after resting on it until its tooltip showed (6 of 6), and the library button's tooltip staying up
/// 5 s after the pointer left it (6 of 6). This view's tooltip showed in each of those cases. The window's toolbar
/// items keep `.help`, which shows there (Streams' Refresh, 12 of 12). The text is this view's own `toolTip`, set again
/// only when it changes; the view takes no clicks, hovers or scrolls, which go on to the control.
