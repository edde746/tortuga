/// Picture in picture on the Mac (PiP is native, not shared): the system's picture in picture window from
/// PIP.framework's `PIPViewController`, private API declared in Tortuga-Bridging-Header.h. This file is its only user,
/// and the Mac app ships as a Developer ID–signed, notarized DMG outside the Mac App Store, where private API is
/// acceptable. Over mpv's `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` the Mac's AVKit mirrors the layer into its window at the layer's
/// size in the player, unscaled, so a window smaller than the player shows a corner of the picture (macOS 27).
///
/// mpv keeps rendering into the same layers throughout: the surface lends them (the display layer and
/// vo_avfoundation's subtitle layer) to a view in the PiP window (`VideoSurface.lendLayers`), which keeps them at the
/// window's size, and takes them back when the window closes, so there is no second video output to switch to. While
/// the window is up the player shows the whole picture
/// (`PlayerStore`'s layout in picture in picture), letterboxed to the window. As on iOS, the window's controls follow
/// the shared `NowPlaying` (playing or paused) and act through its `MediaCommand`s. The window's close button pauses the
/// playback, its return button doesn't; either way the video goes back to the player. The playback ending takes the
/// layers into the player's window for mpv's teardown, then closes the window (`stop`).
