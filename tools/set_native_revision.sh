# Moves Tortuga's mpv dependency to commits of github.com/edde746/mpv-build.
#
# mpv-build publishes content-addressed binaries on every push to main, so a commit names the exact bytes for
# every platform. Each platform records its own commit, and these sites carry the pins:
#   mpv-build.lock.json                 every platform's commit; Android's AAR and the Linux and Windows tarballs
#                                       (Linux and Windows read by build-logic's tortuga.mpv-artifacts plugin;
#                                       Android's by settings.gradle.kts)
#   gradle/verification-metadata.xml    the Android AAR's sha256 again, which Gradle's dependency verification checks
#   apple/project.yml                   the MPVKit Swift package revision (the line tagged "# mpv-build pin"), which
#                                       must equal the lock's apple commit (the tortuga.mpv-artifacts plugin fails
#                                       the build when they differ)
#
# The platforms are pinned apart for now. Android stays below mpv-build's pull request #14 (069cc95f5): from its
# patch 0142 on, subtitles can show a refresh early on MediaTek Android TV boxes, which mpv-build's README warns
# about. Linux and Windows stay with Android on 863bd50bffac. Apple is ahead, on the release whose libplacebo renders
# the user's GLSL shaders on its video output. Once mpv-build fixes the subtitle timing, one plain
# `tools/set_native_revision.sh <rev>` brings every platform back to one revision.
#

#       },
#       "android": {                  the mpv-android library (artifacts.json's mpv-android entry)
#         "commit": "<40-char sha>",  the mpv-build commit this platform is pinned to
#         "assetBase": "https://...", the group's release download base
#         "aar": {
#           "key": "<12-hex>",        its content-address key: the version Gradle resolves
#           "asset": "<file name>",   downloaded as <assetBase>/<asset>
#           "checksum": "<sha256>",
#           "assetBase": "https://..."  only when artifacts.json records one: the release of the publish run that
#                                       built it, which <assetBase>/<asset> uses instead of the group's
#         }
#       },
#       "<group>": {                  linux | windows
#         "commit": "<40-char sha>",  as android's
#         "key": "<12-hex>",          the group's content-address key
#         "assetBase": "https://...", the group's release download base
#         "assets": {
#           "<variant>": {            CPU arch
#             "asset": "<file name>", downloaded as <assetBase>/<asset>
#             "checksum": "<sha256>",
#             "assetBase": "https://..."  as the aar's: the asset's own release, when it has one
#           }
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# mpv-build uploads each publish run's binaries to a release of its own (binaries-<commit>) and leaves a library
# whose sources did not change where an older run put it, so one commit's assets can sit in several releases. An
# asset recorded before that (in the group's binaries-<group> release) has no assetBase of its own.
# Serialization is deterministic (two-space indent, sorted keys, trailing newline). A group the commit has not
# published is omitted and reported; consumers then fail instead of falling back to an unpinned source.
#
# Usage: tools/set_native_revision.sh [--only <android|linux|windows|apple>] <40-char sha | latest>
#   latest = the current head of mpv-build's main branch. Without --only every platform moves to the commit; with it
#   only that platform's entry (and for android gradle/verification-metadata.xml, for apple apple/project.yml) does.
