# Builds the playback matrix: H.264, HEVC HDR10, AV1 HDR10, AV1 at about 30 Mb/s of film grain, MPEG-2, Dolby Vision
# profiles 5 and 8.1,
# DTS-HD MA, TrueHD, ASS, PGS, a 4:3 picture, named chapters (intro, recap and credits skipping), a REMUX-style file
# with many tracks and its next episode with the same languages in another order (tracks carried across episodes).
# The entries live in matrix/spec.py; every file is verified with ffprobe (and dovi_tool) after muxing, and
# tools/media/matrix.json is rewritten from them.
#
# Output: tools/media/out/matrix/ (gitignored; serve.py serves it as /matrix/). Scratch space and downloads:
# tools/media/out/matrix-work/. Override with TORTUGA_MATRIX_OUT / TORTUGA_MATRIX_WORK.
# Options: --force rebuilds everything (unchanged files are otherwise only re-verified); --only ID... limits the run.
#
# Needs ffmpeg (libx264, libx265, libsvtav1), mkvmerge (MKVToolNix), dovi_tool and uv (which fetches the pinned
# numpy and Pillow). Nothing is played.
