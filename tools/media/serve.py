"""Serves tools/media/out/ (or --root) over HTTP with Range support, so mpv can seek (Python's http.server can't).

Usage: tools/media/serve.py [port] [--root <dir>] [--expire 60] [--expire-bytes 0] [--slow-rate 256]
  port            default 8765
  --root          the directory served, default the out/ beside this script; a worktree has none (out/ is gitignored
                  and built in the main checkout), so a harness run from one passes the main checkout's tools/media/out
  --expire        seconds a /t/ link minted by /resolve/ serves before it answers 403
  --expire-bytes  bytes a /t/ link serves in all before it drops its transfer and answers 403 (0: no limit)
  --slow-rate     KiB/s of the /slow/ prefix
The Android emulator reaches it at 10.0.2.2, the iOS/tvOS simulators at 127.0.0.1, other machines at this Mac's
LAN address.

Every file answer (200, 206, 416) but /norange/'s carries Accept-Ranges, an ETag (the file's size and modification
time, so it holds until the file changes), Last-Modified and Content-Disposition (inline, the file's name). A Range
request answers 206, or 416 past the end; with If-Range (an ETag or an HTTP date) it answers 206 when the validator
matches and 200 with the whole file when it doesn't. A request's log line ends with the Range and If-Range it sent, if
any (the download proofs' resumes). Routes besides the plain files (<path> is a file's path, matrix/remux.mkv):
  /<path>?rate=<KiB/s>     any route below takes ?rate=: the body goes out at about that rate (pause/resume proofs)
  /<path>?hold=<name>      the body (a plain file's, /slow/'s, /norange/'s, /redirect/'s, which carries the query along,
                           or the links /resolve/ mints, which keep it) goes out only as far as the hold <name> lets it:
                           each byte spends the hold's allowance, none until /hold/ grants some; with none left, a byte
                           a second, so the connection stays open (a client's idle timeout doesn't end it) while nothing
                           more comes. A download stays partway for as long as a test needs it there, however long its
                           steps take
  /hold/<name>?bytes=<n>   adds n bytes to the hold's allowance; ?bytes=all lifts it: its transfers go on at their rate;
                           ?bytes=none holds them again from their next byte, nothing granted (also after all)
  /slow/<path>             the file at --slow-rate
  /norange/<path>          the file as a server without Range support serves it: 200 with the whole file to every
                           request, its Range ignored, and no Accept-Ranges (so mpv reads it unseekable)
  /redirect/<n>/<path>     302 to /redirect/<n-1>/<path>, the last hop to /<path>: a chain of n hops, each Location
                           relative (../../2/matrix/remux.mkv); ?absolute=1 makes them absolute URLs. The query
                           goes along, and <path> may be another route (/redirect/2/resolve/matrix/remux.mkv)
  /resolve/<path>          a stream host's lazy link: 302 to a fresh /t/<token>/<path> (an absolute URL, as a
                           CDN's). ?expire=<s>, ?bytes=<n>, ?rate=<KiB/s> and ?hold=<name> set that link's lifetime
                           (default --expire), byte budget (default --expire-bytes), rate and hold
  /t/<token>/<path>        the CDN link: the file while the token is fresh, 403 once its lifetime is over (a transfer
                           already going goes on). Past its byte budget the transfer in progress stops short (the
                           connection closes) and every later request answers 403: a link that expires mid-transfer
/resolve/ logs each link it mints (its token, lifetime and byte budget), so a link's renewal reads in the log.
Live HLS made from a VOD one in a single MPEG-TS file (tools/media/make-live.sh: matrix/h264-sdr.m3u8 and .ts, cut at
its 2-s keyframes), looping forever, its segments' place following the wall clock from LIVE_EPOCH, so every server
lists the same ones at the same time, and its time running on across loops (each pass's PCR, PTS, DTS and continuity
counters moved on by the passes before it), as a live channel's does:
  /<path>.live.m3u8        the live media playlist of the VOD one at <path>.m3u8 (matrix/h264-sdr.live.m3u8): the
                           segments that started in the last ?window=<s> seconds (default LIVE_WINDOW) up to the newest
                           complete one, no #EXT-X-ENDLIST; ?ends=<s> ends it that many seconds after the first request
                           of that URL (its query included), from then on listing the same segments with
                           #EXT-X-ENDLIST: an event that ends. ?event=1 makes it an EVENT playlist
                           (#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:EVENT) that keeps every segment from the first request of that URL on,
                           its window growing from ?window= then. ?referer=<value>&agent=<value> make it and its segments
                           answer 403 to a request without that Referer and User-Agent. ?late=<s> answers every third
                           segment that many seconds late, as a live origin that falls behind does. The query goes along
                           to the segments' URLs
  /<path>.live/<n>.ts      its segment n: the VOD playlist's segment n modulo their count, of the pass n div their count
