/**
 * One of the page's rows (the actions, the player app's answers, the seasons, the ranges, the episodes, Cast & crew,
 * and More and the user's rating alone), where Left and Right stay: past the row's end focus stays on its last element;
 * past its start it goes on to what lies beside the page's start edge, where the rows start, the side navigation. More
 * and the user's rating ([toNavigation] false), each at the end of its line, stay too: Left from More went down to Play.
 * Up and Down lead out of the row, to where [up] and [down] move focus (they may keep it with
 * [FocusEnterExitScope.cancelFocusChange]), else to the nearest element that way. A D-pad's move into the row lands
 * where [enter] puts it, else on its element nearest the move.
