 * again when either turns true after being false, so a screen that comes on view with nothing of it focused gets focus
 * too: a stream list opened over a Detail from Home's menu closing hands focus to Detail's Play, not to the navigation.
 * In touch mode (Android, after a tap; desktop, after a click) only the first time: coming back leaves focus alone, as
 * Android focuses nothing while the user touches the screen (clickable elements can't take it then, and the fallback
 * would, raising the keyboard over Search's results). A screen whose [fallback] can sit off screen gives none in touch
 * mode until it is on screen whole (the Board's first card): focus taken after a click or a tap never scrolls the page.
 * An overlay closing over an element that is gone gives focus to [fallback] too.
 *
 * Focus a key took out of the screen since it came on view ([ScreenFocus.keyExits]: the user walked to the navigation
 * while the screen's content was on its way) stays where the user put it while it is outside the screen: on a TV box
 * Home's content arrives seconds after Back, while the remote already walks the navigation column.
 *
 * A screen's content arrives in any order (Home's catalogs, the addons' streams, Detail's library entry after its
 * title), so [fallback] can change after focus came to it. Focus the screen placed itself ([FocusMemory.placedKey]:
 * before the user moved it, pressed, touched or scrolled the screen) follows to the new [fallback], as if the content
 * had come in order; left where it was, it would sit below what came above it (the first press would walk through
 * it), or on Detail's Add to library while Play came.
 *
 * Lazily composed items (a list's rows, a shelf's cards inside a row) can take several frames to attach, more so while
 * the window isn't in front, so it asks once per frame until an element takes focus, for up to [FOCUS_RETRY_FRAMES]
 * frames. Without that, a screen could open with nothing focused, and the arrow keys and the D-pad would do nothing.
