/**
 * A surface the D-pad works in (the player, a screen, a dialog) never sits on view with nothing focused. When the
 * element that has focus in it is disabled or leaves (Previous at the first episode, a row removed, a button swapped
 * for another), Compose drops focus from the whole window, and the platform leaves it nowhere (desktop) or hands it to
 * the window's first element (Android: the player itself, where the D-pad moves nothing, or the navigation). A frame
 * later, and once no surface is handing focus on itself ([AppFocus.handOffs]: a shelf's card to its neighbour; for up
 * to [FOCUS_RETRY_FRAMES] frames), unless focus has come back to one of the surface's elements meanwhile, [home] takes
 * it: [home] moves focus to where the surface keeps it (the player's play/pause, a screen's remembered element or its
 * first) and says whether it could. A control an overlay gave focus back to goes to the control nearest its place
 * instead ([OverlayHost.follow]). While [home] can't (what replaced the element isn't composed yet) the surface holds
 * focus itself, and [home] is asked again each frame for up to [FOCUS_RETRY_FRAMES] frames, then at each D-pad key the
 * surface gets meanwhile: the key takes focus to [home], or where [home] still can't moves it on as it would from the
 * surface. Focus moved on purpose (to a sheet, the navigation, the next screen) is left alone, and so is the touch
 * screen (Android's touch mode focuses nothing). Of surfaces inside one another the innermost takes the drop.
 *
 * Place it before the surface's focus target, the `focusable` the surface is (the player, which holds focus itself
 * while its controls are down); a surface that is a group of elements takes [focusHomeGroup] instead. It needs the app's
 * [com.edde746.tortuga.ui.components.OverlayHostBox] around it, which tells a drop from a move.
