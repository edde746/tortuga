/**
 * The app process's coroutine failure boundary: the exception handler of its main scope
 * ([com.edde746.tortuga.app.AppBootstrap]), which every store's and manager's scope inherits, since each is built from
 * that scope's context. Each of those scopes is a supervisor, so a coroutine that throws ends alone: the other screens,
 * playback and sync go on, and the database transaction it was in rolls back.
 *
 * The boundary logs the exception at ERROR. In the product it then hands it to [failures], which the platform's crash
 * reporter sends while this device's crash reports are on ([CrashReports.failures]), and the app runs on: the screen
 * whose coroutine ended keeps what it showed until it is opened again, which costs the user less than losing playback
 * and every other screen with the process. In a development build or session ([crash]) it rethrows the exception
 * instead, which kotlinx.coroutines hands to the platform's handler for uncaught exceptions: the process ends where the
 * fault happened, with a crash report while reports are on.
