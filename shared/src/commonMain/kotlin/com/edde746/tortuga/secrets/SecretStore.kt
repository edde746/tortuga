package com.edde746.tortuga.secrets

/**
 * The platform's secure storage: Keychain on Apple, an Android Keystore-wrapped store on Android,
 * Windows Credential Manager and libsecret on desktop. It holds the account session's tokens and tracker tokens,
 * none of which may ever reach SQLite, logs or backups.
 *
 * Keys are short ASCII names chosen by the callers (e.g. `account.session`); values are opaque bytes of at most 4 KiB.
 * Implementations scope entries to this app and this OS user, and exclude them from device backups/migration where
 * the platform allows it, so a restored backup never carries a session to another device.
 *
 * Calls may block on platform services, so they suspend; implementations are safe to call from any thread.
