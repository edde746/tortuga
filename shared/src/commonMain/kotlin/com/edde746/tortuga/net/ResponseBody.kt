/**
 * Reads [this] response's body with [read], then cancels what [read] left unread. Inside `HttpStatement.execute`
 * (`prepareGet`, `prepareRequest`), where the body streams from the engine, every read of the body goes through it.
 *
 * `bodyAsChannel()` is a copy of the body that a coroutine of the client fills, at most 1 MiB ahead of the reader, and
 * `execute`'s cleanup cancels the engine's body but not that copy. A copy left uncancelled with its buffer full keeps
 * that coroutine waiting for a reader: when the block given to `execute` returns, the cleanup waits for the coroutine,
 * so `execute` returns only when its caller times out; when the block fails, the coroutine stays suspended, holding its
 * buffer, as long as the client lives. Cancelling the copy ends the coroutine and, with it, the request.
