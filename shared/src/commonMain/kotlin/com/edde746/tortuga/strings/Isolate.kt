 * [text] the app didn't write (an addon's title, a cast member, a person's or a device's name), ready to sit inside an
 * app string: first-strong isolates (U+2068 … U+2069) give it the direction of its own first letter and keep it from
 * reordering the app's words and punctuation around it, so "4. What If...?" and "With Robert Downey Jr." read in order
 * in a right-to-left language, and an Arabic title in order in a left-to-right one. Empty text stays empty.
