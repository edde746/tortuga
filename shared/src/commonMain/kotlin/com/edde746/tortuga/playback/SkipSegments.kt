/**
 * Intros, recaps and credits from the video's chapters (mpv's chapter list is the only source: there are no server
 * markers). A chapter ends where the next starts, the last at the duration.
 *
 * - Intros and credits: [ChapterMarkerClassifier] picks at most one chapter of each from the titles and times of the
 *   whole list, so an episode whose chapters are all "Chapter N" or untitled has them too, a cold open titled "Intro"
 *   before "OP" stays content, and names no list has ("Abertura", "Staff Roll") count. The chapters beside a pick that
 *   the model is as sure of, and those right after it whose titles say the same kind, join it. Where the model picks
 *   none of a kind, the titles decide it as they do recaps and previews.
 * - Recaps and previews, and a chapter titled as one whatever the model says: its whole title, normalised
 *   ([normalize]: trimmed, lower case, without a leading "Chapter 3 -" or "03." and a trailing number), matched
 *   against the names in [TITLES] and the prefixes in [PREFIXES]: never a word anywhere in it, so a movie's "The
 *   Ending" stays content.
 * - Adjacent chapters of the same kind make one segment.
 * - Credits followed only by previews run to the end ([SkipSegment.toEnd]), previews included, and so does a preview at
 *   the end without credits before it. Credits followed by more of the video (a post-credits scene) end where that
 *   starts; a preview anywhere else isn't skipped.
 * - Intros and recaps start in the first third of the video and last at most [MAX_OPENING_SECONDS] (a movie's long
 *   "Opening credits" are the film); credits start in its second half. Anything shorter than [MIN_SECONDS] is ignored.
