 * The frame mpv places bottom subtitles in, on the player's surface; `sub-pos` moves them by a share of its height.
 * Plain-text subtitles sit in the whole surface where an engine leaves mpv's default (`sub-use-margins=yes`: [SCREEN])
 * and in the picture where it places them by the video (`sub-use-margins=no`): the surface less the bands mpv's
 * `osd-dimensions` reports above and below the picture ([picture]). The player's controls are measured on the surface
 * ([PlayerEngine.setSubtitleLift]); [lift] turns them into a lift in this frame, which [SubtitleStyle.position] makes
 * mpv's `sub-pos`.
 *
 * @param height the surface's height (`osd-dimensions/h`).
 * @param top the band above the frame (`osd-dimensions/mt`), in the unit of [height]; 0 for the whole surface.
 * @param bottom the band below the frame (`osd-dimensions/mb`); 0 for the whole surface. Negative bands (a picture
 *   zoomed past the surface's edges) put the frame's edges off the surface.
