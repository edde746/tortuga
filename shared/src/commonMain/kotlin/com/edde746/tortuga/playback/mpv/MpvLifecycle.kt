/**
 * One engine's mpv as [EngineState], one rule for Android, desktop and Apple: each file's lifecycle (a load, then mpv's
 * `start-file`, `file-loaded`, `playback-restart` and `end-file`), what a new file starts over, and the properties every
 * engine observes ([DOUBLES], [FLAGS], [TEXTS]; [AUDIO_DEVICE_TEXTS] where the player picks the output) with the field
 * each one sets ([MpvState]'s rules). The engine keeps mpv's handle and its events, its surfaces and its audio route:
 * it hands each event, observed value and log line here, from one thread at a time (its mpv thread, or under its state
 * lock), with what only the platform knows ([hold], [outputRange], [stats], [fail]), and publishes [state] when
 * [publishable] says so.
 *
 * A new file (a load, and mpv's `start-file`) starts over what is the file's own: its position and length, what is
 * read ahead, its tracks and chapters, its end, its error, its first frame and the playback info's reading. What mpv's
 * outputs and decoder report (the video, the audio, the hardware decoder, whether the file seeks, passthrough, the
 * output's dynamic range) and the player's settings stay until mpv reports others: mpv sends an observed property only
 * when it differs from what it sent last, as of when the engine reads its events, so a spell without a value between
 * two files can go unseen, and a value the next file repeats doesn't come again.
