/**
 * The frame rate an Android MediaCodec decoder is told to be ready for (MediaFormat `operating-rate`, mpv's
 * `hwdec-mediacodec-operating-rate`).
 *
 * Vendors pick the codec's clock from this number, not from the stream. On a Pixel 7, Tensor's AV1 block with nothing
 * declared decoded 30 Mb/s 1080p24 film grain at 40 ms a frame, which played at 5-8 fps; with 60 declared it took 18
 * ms a frame. The content rate alone (24) changed nothing: the vendor provisions for a typical bitrate at that rate,
 * and a heavy one needs headroom over it. Only some stacks read the number (Tensor, Qualcomm); within the codec's
 * advertised range it does no harm on the rest, and MediaTek's decoders are configured without it.
