/**
 * Picks audio and subtitle tracks by the profile's language preferences and the system's caption and
 * audio-description settings ([com.edde746.tortuga.playback.MediaAccessibilityPreferences]). Preferences are canonical
 * BCP 47 tags ([LanguageTags]), most preferred first; a track matches a preference by language, and one with the
 * preferred region or script too wins over one without.
 *
 * Audio: the best track in the most preferred language the file has. Among equal matches: an audio description first
 * when the system asks for them and last otherwise, then not a commentary, then the default track, then file order.
 * None preferred or none present keeps the file's own choice, put right for audio descriptions: the audio description
 * in its language when the system asks for them, the plain track in its language when it plays one nobody asked for.
 *
 * Subtitles follow the audio, the way Plex's "shown with foreign audio" and Jellyfin's "smart" modes do:
 * - audio in a language the user doesn't read subtitles in (no preferred subtitle language matches it), or of
 *   unknown language, gets full subtitles in the most preferred language available (not forced, embedded before
 *   external, default first), else forced ones in a preferred language;
 * - audio in a preferred subtitle language, or no subtitle preference at all, gets only forced subtitles in the
 *   audio's language (they translate the parts in yet another language), else subtitles off.
 *
 * SDH ranks after plain subtitles, unless captions are on (the profile's Show subtitles is Always, or the system's
 * captions are: Closed Captions + SDH, Android's captions): then SDH ranks first, and the second case gets full
 * subtitles in the audio's language, else in the most preferred language available, and its forced ones only when
 * there are none.
 *
 * A track the user picked in another file of the show is matched first ([carried]). The second subtitle, shown at the
 * top of the picture, is the best full subtitle in its one language ([second]).
