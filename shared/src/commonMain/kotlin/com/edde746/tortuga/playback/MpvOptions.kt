 * The mpv options every engine sets, on every platform, before its own and before `mpv_initialize`.
 * libmpv's own `[libmpv]` profile (mpv's `etc/builtin.conf`) already turns off config files, the terminal, mpv's input
 * bindings and the OSC everywhere; platform options (`vo`, `ao`, `hwdec-*`, `gpu-*`, HDR, subtitle fonts) stay in each
 * engine.
 *
 * mpv's other builtin scripts are all off: the app uses none, and each is a Lua state and thread of its own in every
 * player.
 * ytdl_hook hooks every load, with nothing to resolve in a resolved stream URL; auto_profiles, at its default `auto`,
 * hooks the load and exits for want of a conditional profile, so a file opening meanwhile logs "client removed during
 * hook handling". Their options exist only in a libmpv with Lua (Android's, Windows', Linux's and macOS's, not iOS' or
 * tvOS'), `load-scripts` only in one with some scripting: the Apple engine skips the options its libmpv doesn't know.
