/**
 * The seek bar's buffered part as mpv reports what it read, through an engine's [MpvLifecycle] to the store's timeline.
 * mpv sends `time-pos` at every frame and what its demuxer read with each cache update: every quarter second while it
 * reads, and once it has read the whole file only once the position moved a second since the last one. Its
 * `cache-duration` counts from the demuxer's reader, which runs ahead of the position by what the decoders hold.
