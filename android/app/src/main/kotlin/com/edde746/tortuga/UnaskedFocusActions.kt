/**
 * Turns a Next or Previous editor action a text field didn't ask for (its [EditorInfo.imeOptions] action) into putting
 * the keyboard away, focus and the cursor staying where they are. Fire TV's keyboard answers Back with Previous
 * instead of closing itself, whatever action the field asked for, and then moves the cursor to the text's start
 * (`setSelection(0, 0)`, seen on the Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire OS 8, 26 Oct); Compose answers an action the field has no
 * handler for by its default, which for those two moves focus out of the field (the keyboard closing with it): to the
 * element before it, or, from a screen's first element (Search's field), around to the TV column. So the cursor move
 * that follows such an action is dropped: the cursor stays after what was typed, where the next letters go and where
 * Right leaves the field (`remoteLeavesField`); until then the next letter went before the text and Right moved the
 * cursor. Every text field's connection goes through it ([androidx.compose.ui.platform.InterceptPlatformTextInput]
 * around the app's content), so Back with the keyboard up closes it and leaves focus and the cursor on the field, as
 * the other boxes' keyboards do.
