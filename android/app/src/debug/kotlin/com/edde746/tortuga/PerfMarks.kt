 * gc=<ART's GC count> gcms=<ART's GC time in ms>`, then the mark's `k=v` details. The screens mark through
 * [PerfProbe] (ui/probe), the mpv engine through [AndroidPlatform.mpvEvents] (`engine.load`, `engine.loadfile`,
 * `engine.playing`, `engine.terminate`), and [focusProbe] marks `focus probe=<probe name>` and `blur probe=<probe
 * name>` as a named control gains and loses focus, which the harness walks the D-pad by. The key press is the last key
 * down (not a repeat) any of the app's activities received, read in front of the activity's own dispatch. The launch's
 * first `home.content` mark reports the activity fully drawn.
